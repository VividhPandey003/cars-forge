### Purpose

Forge is a Python-based command-line tool that starts a single or cluster of EC2 instances, and runs the required scripts on these instances. Forge can be used by anyone to create their own environment where they can do anything like develop products, analyze data, host interactive dashboards, or run production workloads on terabytes of RAM. Forge gives you complete flexibility while making it easy to run everything on spot EC2 instances saving you up to 90% compared to on-demand instances.

### Features

- Create a single or cluster of EC2 instances of any size using spot or on-demand pricing
- Rsync files to the instance(s)
- Run a script on the instance(s)
- Destroy your EC2 fleet
- SSH into your master or single instance
- Start and Stop your on-demand instance(s)
